<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>
<p>My professional life always revolved around computers in general. Starting my career as system administrator, I have made my way through deployment engineer to finally settle on software development, being the most creative regime of IT. Being full-time programmer since late 2015, I have gained expertise in multiple languages and technologies, with my preferred backend choices being Clojure and Common Lisp.
When it comes to full-stack jobs, I extend my Lisp familiarity with ClojureScript gaining full advantage from purely unified frontend and backend.</p>
<p>When possible, I choose to join projects in early stages, still on whiteboard - where there is still serious R&amp;D to be done and solutions are yet to be found.</p>
<p>By involvement in side jobs and engagement in devops activities in my daily works, I constantly improve my system administration and deployment skills. As it turns out, especially in small startup teams, it is highly desired addition to have somebody capable of wiring things together in professional manner.</p>
<p>Other than IT, truly enjoy working with hardware hardware. I often spent my spare time between Fusion 360 and my workshop - but with deliberate choice of remote career, it mostly my hobby with only occasional 3D printing / CAD jobs.</p>

My role here is leading developer of high-performance data collection system with special business logic, designed to mitigate problem of knowledge separation between high-level management and low-level experts, necessary for collection of precise metrics. Tool stack consists of Clojure with Liberator, Spec, gRPC, Quartz scheduler and PostgreSQL.</p>
