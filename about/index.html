## What I do

My professional life always revolved around computers in general. Starting my career as system administrator, I have made my way through deployment engineer to finally settle on software development, being the most creative regime of IT. Being full-time programmer since late 2015, I have gained expertise in multiple languages and technologies, with my preferred backend choices being Clojure and Common Lisp.
When it comes to full-stack jobs, I extend my Lisp familiarity with ClojureScript gaining full advantage from purely unified frontend and backend.

When possible, I choose to join projects in early stages, still on whiteboard - where there is still serious R&D to be done and solutions are yet to be found. 

By involvement in side jobs and engagement in devops activities in my daily works, I constantly improve my system administration and deployment skills. As it turns out, especially in small startup teams, it is highly desired addition to have somebody capable of wiring things together in professional manner.

Other than IT, truly enjoy working with hardware hardware. I often spent my spare time between Fusion 360 and my workshop - but with deliberate choice of remote career, it mostly my hobby with only occasional 3D printing / CAD jobs.

## Senior Software Devleoper at Emergynt
##### Dec 2015 – Present
I have joined Emergynt as a one of first developers at the very beginning of company existence. With very small team and limited resources, this startup made long way from designing innovative security appliance to innovative cyber risk assessment platform written in Common Lisp and utilizing Neo4j graph database. My role here is leading developer of high-performance data collection system with special business logic, designed to mitigate problem of knowledge separation between high-level management and low-level experts, necessary for collection of precise metrics. Tool stack consists of Clojure with Liberator, Spec, gRPC, Quartz scheduler and PostgreSQL. 

## Software Developer at Cyber Risk Research
##### Apr 2018 – Nov 2018
In this side project my responsibilities were designing and implementing solution for problem identified by client, focusing around innovative secure email messaging platform. Backend was written in Clojure with Libearator where frontend was developed as ClojureScript SPA made with reagent, re-frame and bootstrap.

## System Administrator at Magnum2
##### Feb 2016 – Present
My responsibilities in Magnum2 cover variety of system and network administration activities in multiple healthcare-oriented facilities, ranging from NixOS deployments, through backup management, up to expert support for governmental-healthcare institutions.

## Deployment Engineer at CodiLime
##### May 2014 – Feb 2016
I have joined CodiLime at the time company was starting to transition from startup into viable business. Participating in one of company’s major projects with major Silicon Valley company as a client, I have been working on transition of our software into real product. My Continuous Integration environment, maade with Jenkins and Puppet, together with Docker development environments for every programmer played key role in this process.

## System Administrator/Software Developer at VTS Software
##### May 2011 – May 2014
In May 2011 I joined VTS Software, then small software house working on product for huge pharmacy corporations. My responsibilities varied from regular system and network administration, through Asterisk-based VoIP setups, VM management and Puppet orchestration. I have been also responsible for research and development of experimental voice assistant for TV set top boxes, written in Python.
