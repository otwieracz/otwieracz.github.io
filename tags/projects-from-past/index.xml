      <description>Building all-metal 3D printer Back in 2017 there were no cheap-and-good 3D printer readily available on the market. Basically all that was available were budget Prusa clones, but neither rigid nor especially cheap. That&#39;s why I started designing my own construction of heavy-weight all-metal FDM 3D printer with some lightweight CNC routing in mind. As it turned out, it was rather nice 3D printer but not very practical CNC router.</description>
