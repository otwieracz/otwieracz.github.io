      <title>CNC Router - Part 3: Testing</title>

      <description>Adding &amp;#34;backplate&amp;#34; reinforcements As expected, so-called backplate was showing too much deflection to be acceptable - quick fix was to add L-sections on both of its sides, preventing bending when loaded.    Wiring electronics   Import BigTreeTech SKR1.3 acting as a Smoothieware host Based on All-metal 3D printer experiences, single electronics cabinet containing all components is not the best solution. With everything packed so tight cooling is problematic and while maintenance is already difficult, debugging is simply impossible.</description>

      <description>Tracing holes with 3D printer Biggest difference in new design as compared to 3D printer is X and Z carriage made from two 4mm thick steel plates. This makes for really simple, fast and what&#39;s most important *straight* assembly - but only under circumstance that all holes will be drilled precisely at locations. Toolpaths were generated with Fusion 360 manufacturing module.       3D printer executing it&amp;#39;s last GCODE before rebuild Even slight imprecision between holes within one plate will cause linear bearings on shafts to bind and things to go out of parallel in general - with no way of correcting that.</description>

      <title>CNC Router - Part 1: Design</title>

      <description>Design Major design criteria for CNC router were directly influenced by lessons learned from All-metal 3D Printer  FDM printer are slow, it&#39;s worth sacrificing Z travel for additional rigidity. Use single motor for each axis to guarantee squareness after homing. As this is still research slash fun project, keep costs low by reusing as many parts as possible. Keep it manufacture-able with tools I have, but try limiting places where it will require tuning.</description>

      <title>Tour-throw for Rottefella Chili</title>

      <description>Tour-throw is common name for simple way of loosening spring tension in telemark ski bindings, especially useful for long tours over flat terrains. Soon after publishing replacement tour-throw heel levers for my G3 Targa Telemark Bindings on Thingiverse I&#39;ve been asked to design and manufacture similar part to Rottefella Chili bindings, which do not come with such feature out of the box.      Finished part Design was pretty straightforward, but required few iterations to ensure that under rapid disengagement, bottom joint won&#39;t bend and disconnect from slot in other half of heel lever, causing increasing loads and failure.</description>

      <title>All-metal 3D Printer</title>

      <description>Building all-metal 3D printer Back in 2017 there were no cheap-and-good 3D printer readily available on the market. Basically all that was available were budget Prusa clones, but neither rigid nor especially cheap. That&#39;s why I started designing my own construction of heavy-weight all-metal FDM 3D printer with some lightweight CNC routing in mind. As it turned out, it was rather nice 3D printer but not very practical CNC router.</description>
