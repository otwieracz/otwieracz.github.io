      <description>Debug helper which I&#39;ve been always missing - minimal helper for instrumenting (clojure.spec.alpha/valid?) with more verbose output.
This should be treated as debug facility and not be enabled on production by default - especially, when there are spec/valid? statements expected to fail non-catastrophically used in performace-sensitive parts of code.
Kudos to @github/bhb for expound library which made this little helper possible.
My setup Following profiles.clj configuration:

      <description>Prometheus exporter for BURP backup program burp written in Python.
burp_exporter operates directly on BURP spool directory thus has to be running on the same machine as server, but does not require complex configuration as a client of monitor protocol.
See burp_exporter on GitHub for more info.</description>

      <description>When it comes to gRPC in Clojure, there is (what seem like) great library clojusc/protobuf. Unfortunately, for someone without any past gRPC experience, it has quite steep learning curve as it&#39;s difficult to relate it directly to official Java documenation available on https://grpc.io.
I have created clj-grpc partly as a gRPC learning exercise, but mainly to use it in one of our projects in Emergynt. I tried not to reinvent any wheels in process, but just provide hassle-free experience without unnecessary Java interop while strongly reassembling workflow from well documented Java bindings.</description>

      <description>Swagger become de-facto standard for REST API documentation, so it was obvious choice for describing liberator resources I was exposing in one of Emergynt projects. There is awesome metosin/spec-tools library enabling generation of Swagger definitions from Spec.
It seemed like good fit to merge liberator with spec-tools:
 Documentation is written where inside resource definition, keeping code well organized and easy to understand. Various handlers, like handle-not-found or handle-malformed can be generated automatically for meaningful error messages.</description>
