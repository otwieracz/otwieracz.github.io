      <description>CNC-Router v1 (2020) Design Designing overall construction based on hardware left from all-metal 3D printer.             
Mechanical construction Building V1 of new CNC-Router. Some design issues are becoming clearly visible - X axis rigidity in reality does not exist, 20mm linear shafts are really not rigid enough without any support at that length.
Some parts were made using to-be-disassembled 3D printer.</description>
