        <h3>Building all-metal 3D printer</h3>
        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    Back in 2017 there were no cheap-and-good 3D printer readily available on the market. Basically all that was
    available were budget Prusa clones, but neither rigid nor especially cheap. That's why I started designing my own
    construction of heavy-weight all-metal FDM 3D printer with some lightweight CNC routing in mind.

    As it turned out, it was rather nice 3D printer but not very practical CNC router.

    *NOTE*: This is post-factum description of historical project, so it's already known how it turned out.

    <h2>Design and build</h2>
    <div class="img-p">
    <a href="concept.png">

    <div>
        <h3>First concept</h3>
        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    By the time I have been designing this printer, only 3D modelling tool I had any grasp of was Blender. It was not
    especially delightful experience, but I've made my way through it somehow.

    One of first concepts was cubical in form, with moving printing table as X axis:

    <div>
        <h3>Selected design</h3>
        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    Another one had X axis stacked on top of Y and Z, enabling heated bed to be immobile and rigid. Although it sounded
    great, it required a lot of linear bearings and rods, essentially skyrocketing overall price tag. Taking this into
    consideration, I have settled on more "standard" approach with Y being mobile heatbed, X being stacked on top of Z
    powered by two trapezoidal screws. As it turned out, it wasn't the smartest choice for a CNC router.

    <div>
        <h3>Build</h3>
        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    Not much to talk about - starting with concept shown above, I've made my way through build. General idea was to keep
    things adjustable, as I had no tools to hard-build everything precisely and straight enough.
    <ul>
        <li>Frame made of 4040 aluminum extrusions</li>
        <li>20mm linear rods with linear bearings</li>
        <li>Z powered by 10mm trapezoidal screws</li>
        <li>X and Y controlled via rack and pinion</li>
        <li>Everything driven with Arduino+RAMPS (later exchanged for MKS Sbase running Smoothieware)</li>
    </ul>
    
        </div>
    </div>

        <h3>Acrylic case</h3>
        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    As a part of CNC routing experience, I spent some time designing and building acrylic case for the device.
    Unfortunately, it turned out to be a dead end. Ability to access the workspace only from one side (front) was too
    limiting and not worth the effort.

            <h3>3D Printing test</h3>
            <p>
                As a 3D printer, certainly great thing here was rigidity - after bed has been leveled, there's no way
                something become loose or required repeated calibration. I could keep printing repeatedly remotely, with
                just somebody keeping an eye if nothing's on fire.

        <h3>CNC routing</h3>
        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    Dual Z screws and motors become real issue for any routing (milling) operations. Asymmetrical load in Z axis
    (operations like drilling with X axis being far of center) easily caused opposite motor to lose steps - virtually
    rendering machine useless until I re-level Z axis again. I could fight that with better stepper control and multiple
    Z endstops, but it just kept bugging me.

    <p>
    I have recently purchased another 3D printer, for smaller work (Anycubic Kossel Linear). This changed my priorities
    a bit - by having separate general purpose 3D printer, I could sacrifice some FDM-specific capabilities for
    usability as CNC router. That's how rebuilding this printer into CNC router become a thing.

    See <a href=https://slawekgonet.pl/posts/cnc-router-p1/>CNC Router - Part 1</a>, where I track progress rebuilding this machine into
    lightweight, desktop CNC router.
