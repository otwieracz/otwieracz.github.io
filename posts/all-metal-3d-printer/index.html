<p>Back in 2017 there were no cheap-and-good 3D printer readily available on the market. Basically all that was available were budget Prusa clones, but neither rigid nor especially cheap. That's why I started designing my own construction of heavy-weight all-metal FDM 3D printer with some lightweight CNC routing in mind.</p>
<p>As it turned out, it was rather nice 3D printer but not very practical CNC router.</p>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: This is post-factum description of historical project, so it's already known how it turned out.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>By the time I have been designing this printer, only 3D modelling tool I had any grasp of was Blender. It was not especially delightful experience, but I've made my way through it somehow.</p>
<p>One of first concepts was cubical in form, with moving printing table as X axis:
<img src="concept.png" alt="First Concept" title="First concept"> First concept</p>
<p>Another one had X axis stacked on top of Y and Z, enabling heated bed to be immobile and rigid. Although it sounded great, it required a lot of linear bearings and rods, essentially skyrocketing overall price tag. Taking this into consideration, I have settled on more &ldquo;standard&rdquo; approach with Y being mobile heatbed, X being stacked on top of Z powered by two trapezoidal screws. As it turned out, it wasn't the smartest choice for a CNC router.</p>

<h2 id="build">Build</h2>
<p>Not much to talk about - starting with concept shown above, I've made my way through build. General idea was to keep things adjustable, as I had no tools to hard-build everything precisely and straight enough.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frame made of 4040 aluminium extrusions</li>
<li>20mm linear rods with linear bearings</li>
<li>Z powered by 10mm trapezoidal screws</li>
<li>X and Y controlled via rack and pinion</li>
<li>Everything driven with Arduino+RAMPS (later exchanged for MKS Sbase running Smoothieware)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>I have recently bought another 3D printer, for smaller work (Anycubic Kossel Linear). This changed my priorities a bit - by having separate general purpose 3D printer, I could sacrifice some FDM-specific capabilities for usability as CNC router. That's how rebuilding this printer into CNC router become a thing.</p>
<p>As a 3D printer, certainly great thing here was rigidity - after bed has been leveled, there's no way something become loose or required repeated calibration. I could keep printing repeatedly remotely, with just family members keeping an eye if nothing's on fire.</p>
<p>However, dual Z screws and motors become real issue for any milling operations. Asymmetrical load in Z axis (operations like drilling with X axis being far of center) easily caused opposite motor to lose steps - virtually rendering machine useless until I re-level Z axis again. I could fight that with better stepper control and multiple Z endstops, but it just kept bugging me.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://slawekgonet.pl/posts/cnc-router-p1/">CNC Router - Part 1</a>, where I track progress rebuilding this machine into lightweight, desktop CNC router.</p>
