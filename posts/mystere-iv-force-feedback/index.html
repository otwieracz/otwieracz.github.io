    This project actually started many years ago, when I managed to purchase what been told was "Joystick from old
    French fighter plane". Back in the day I've planned to use it as a base for upgrade of Logitech WingMan Force 3D -
    but project somehow got stuck and finally forgotten.
    Recently I came across this joystick once again. After some digging I was no longer convinced if it indeed
    originated from real fighter:
    <ul>
        <li>Seems like it's fly-by-wire (there was just one potentiometer, place for what looked like another one and no
            obvious place for any mechanical linkage)</li>
        <li>Such kind of joystick, with just 4 buttons, was last present in Dassault Mystère (in service between
            1954-1963) - but it was mounted directly to mechanical steering column, no electronics involved.</li>
    </ul>
    Either way, I decided to give it another try. I've ditched WingMan Force, because with no new Force Feedback
    joystick produced for many years now it seemed like dead end and decided to use custom electronics.

        <h3>Electronics and software</h3>
        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    This setup requires few words of explanation. Around 10 years ago, back before Arduino, there was DIY joystick
    project called MJoy16, based on ATMega16. I was considering build of "auxiliary controller", with multiple switches,
    levers and potentiometers for flying simulators - and there was someone in the community selling nicely fabricated
    PCB's which I've ordered. Boards came, went to shelf and stayed there.
    <br />
    Fast-forward 10 years: I am building new joystick and there is Arduino-based MJoy2. Obviously it isn't compatible
    with MJoy16 boards - but after careful analysis I realized that I can still use it as a button-matrix platform. An
    hour of of wire-wrapping and soldering later I had board ready to connect inputs.

        <h3>Original two-state switch</h3>
        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    Joystick in it's original state had one primary flaw - it lacked POV switch. I had only one two-state thumb-operated
    switch. I thought about providing directional switch of the base operated with left hand, but finally I came to
    conclusion that requiring both hands to fly *and* look around will be very inconvenient - imagine not being able to
    look around when operating throttle.
    This being told, I decided to replace original switch with 3D printed adapter hosting 2 analog axes and one
    button - for viewport control and reset.

        <h3>Custom POV switch assembly</h3>
        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    Original switch has been replaced by PSP two-axis analog thumb joystick and button mounted inside 3D printed housing
    designed to fit in place of the original.

        <h3>Simple testbed</h3>
        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    Before going any further with the project, I screwed all the basic components on piece of wood just to test it. It
    was important to verify that:
    <ul>
        <li>Joystick with subtle centering of only pitch axis feel uncomfortable.</li>
        <li>How does it feel with Cessna-style throttle controls (here mocked by M5 bolt).</li>
    </ul>
    In the end it turned out to be acceptable. My only concern is this axis centering mechanism - I am not convinced if
    it's better to have one axis centered or keep them both free, just with some preloaded tension.

    <h2>Making case and final assembly</h2>

        <h3>Cutting case panels</h3>
        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    Having whole device designed and assembled in Fusion 360, it made it straightforward to cut all the
    necessary panels out of plywood on CNC router. All parts were later cut out of stock, sanded and then waxed to
    prevent wood from degradation.

        <h3>Throttle, mixture and propeller pitch bushings</h3>
        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    To prevent levers from binding when going through tight hole in plywood, I've press-fit self-lubricating bronze
    bushings for M6 bolts to slide in. Sliding part of those obviously won't be threaded.

        <h3>Trimming electronics board</h3>
        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    Before continuing with assembly, I had to precisely trim electronics board of unused parts. This allowed to make
    whole package much more compact without sacrificing anything (maybe other than ease of assembly).
    
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Wire-wrapping switches</h3>
        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    Next step was to make all the wiring and test it one more time before final assembly. I first planned to go with
    standard 2.54mm raster "goldpin" plugs, but it made no sense - wire wrapping created solid, reversible connections
    without the hassle of having to crimp tenths of connectors only to (hopefully) never see them again.

    Time to put everything together. To prevent sliders from catching any loose wires inside I've made simple guards
    from sheet of paper.

        <div class="img-p-p">
            
    It required more than one attempt to lay everything together properly, but finallly joystick is completed. I am not
    totally satisfied with quality of used encoders - seems like there is possibility for them to stop "in the middle of
    movement", causing problems with other buttons in a row - but time will tell. If it becomes annoying, I'll change
    them.
